:--- Wallpaper ---:
Positron Dream has some absolutely beautiful wallpapers. Using the color scheme outlined by elenapan I edited the wallpaper "5,400 (Final)" to match the colors I needed for both the Pollux and Castor versions.

:--- Color Scheme / Inspiration ---:
I am a user of both Linux and Windows. u/EmpressNoodle9 posted on Reddit's UnixPorn their "Mechanical Love" theme utilizing their Lovelace color scheme. Inspired by both the color scheme and their setup, I created a Windows-similar version that has now morphed into "Gemini".
