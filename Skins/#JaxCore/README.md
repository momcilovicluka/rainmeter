## About üëÄ

![GithubBanner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80020581/173227081-761ae822-6c83-4a10-9093-a3117c2cffd7.png)

JaxCore is a collection of utility modules designed to improve your desktop experience and increase your productivity. Core is a configuration hub that allows for quick access to settings, updates, and new releases.

## Features ‚ú®
JaxCore is an absolute must-have, and here's why:

### Interactive Modules

Tired of scribbling notes on a notepad? Dislike the appearance of your cluttered desktop? Want to get rid of those annoying shortcuts? Core has got you covered. All of the aforementioned feats are easily accomplished with Core's elementary modules.

### Easy configuration

Core makes customization easier for new users by providing a dedicated configuration menu for each skin, eliminating the need for the user to modify the code or write their own.

### Update Checker

The built-in update checker in Core will ensure that you never miss out on new features or bug fixes. Core can also notify you when new skin updates are available for the skins you have installed. You can install all of the updates with a single button press, and Core will handle the rest.
